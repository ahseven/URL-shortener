# URL-shortener
final project for Computer Science A by SEATH Arthirith

It is a fairly simple code to shorten a link with a long blob of text, revert the shortened link to the original and an optional QR code to scan the link if you don't want to use or click the link! 
to install it is very simple, you can copy the code directly from the linkshortener.py file and run it in VScode or Pycharm that are for Python.
To make sure it working properly, you have to pip install the libraries necessary to run the app. then you are set and done to start running and use the link shortner on your terminal!
